          I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies at the Slovak University
          of Technology. During my studies, I focused on artificial intelligence, deep learning, participating in several research projects
          related to the application of deep learning and computer vision in the field of medicine. My Master's thesis and research delved
          into deep neural networks in the domain of medical image processing, with a specific focus on the segmentation of higher morphological
          structures for identifying possible cardiac transplant rejection.

          Multilingual low-resource language processing presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities in the field of natural language processing.
          As our increasingly connected world brings together people from diverse linguistic backgrounds, the need to support multiple languages, especially
          those with limited resources, has become paramount. In this context, the use of advanced machine learning techniques, such as cross-lingual transfer
          learning and multilingual embeddings, has gained prominence. These approaches enable models to leverage knowledge from resource-rich languages to
          improve the performance of low-resource language processing tasks.

          Additionally, when working with low-resource languages, we often encounter linguistic diversity and complexity that demand special attention. Each
          language has its unique features, such as different alphabets, grammar structures, and word forms. Adapting models to these variations is essential
          for accurate understanding and processing. Moreover, as we strive to support low-resource languages, we must address the issue of limited data
          resources. To tackle these challenges, researchers are continually exploring innovative algorithmic approaches, data augmentation methods,
          and collaborative initiatives to expand linguistic resources for underrepresented languages. In this multilingual landscape, the pursuit of
          effective low-resource language processing solutions remains a vital imperative for research and development.
